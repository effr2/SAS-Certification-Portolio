# SAS-Certificate-Portolio
This portfolio collects assignments and projects from multiple coursework(STA3024, STA3064, STA4203, STA4853 done over the years at FSU that showcase SAS code for different use cases. this portfolio was collected for the SAS Certification. A PDF containing all the projects with their respective code is included in this repo. If you prefer to see each assignment individually, you can look to the specific folders.

## Requirements:

All code is implemented in SAS. 

## Project Descriptions and Instructions

In the table below, you will find a short description of all the assignments collected in the portofolio.

|STA 3024- Project Phase A and B|`Phase A involves choosing a topic, describing a motivation for studying the topic, finding data that allows to explore the topic more deeply, reading the data into SAS, and structuring/manipulating the data so that it may be analyzed effectively in later phases. Phase B involves Data Exploration via Graphical Displays, Data Description via Numerical Summaries, and a preliminary analysis of any relationships that exist in the data. ` |[Instructions for Assignment 1](https://github.com/effr2/STA5635-Applied-Machine-Learning/blob/master/hw1-decision%20trees/Hw01-Instructions.pdf)  			
|STA 3064- Case Study|`In recent years, teen pregnancy has been a major issue in the United States. The objective of this study is to find out which economic indicators can be used to predict the teenage birth rate in large metropolitan areas. This study will focus on the city of Chicago. The hope is that by finding factors that contribute to teen pregnancy, a better understanding of prevention can be found to inform public policy makers.`|[Instructions for Assignment 3](https://github.com/effr2/STA5635-Applied-Machine-Learning/blob/master/hw3-logistic%20regression/Hw03-Instructions.pdf)
